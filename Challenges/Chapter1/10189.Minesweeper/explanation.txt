The solution while reading the input checks whether there are the bombs and save them in a dedicated vector.
O(n*m) 

Now that we have the bombs represented as a pair, we can loop over them and call a function that uses an add function 8 times.
one for every direction , where the current iterated bomb is in the center.

the add function will check whether we are outside to the matrix or we are trying to add on another bomb represente by -1 in the matrix.
